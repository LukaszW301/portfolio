## About Me
My name is Łukasz Wierzbicki. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice from Governors State University in Illinois, USA. Some time ago I became highly interested in software testing and every aspect of developing projects in Information Technology. I strive to become experienced software tester and dive deeper into world of IT. On this site I would like to share some of the things I've learned as a student of Software Development Academy and through my own research.
